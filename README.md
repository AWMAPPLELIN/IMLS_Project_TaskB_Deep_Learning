# IMLS_Project_TaskB_Deep_Learning
The main work of this task is to use deep learning methods CNN to do multiclass classification operations of MRI images.
As for the files in this project, the function of the file: Data_pre_processing is for processing the image data by converting each image to a matrix and making labels for different images; the function of the main file is the trunk of the whole task and it includes the realization of CNN model for multiclass classification.
The running environment for this is python 3.8 and you could download all the files and create a virtual environment to run all of them in the software PyCharm. In the main file, it calls all other files and you could obtain the final result from it while pre-processed dataset including MRI_Image_Matrix.multi.npy could be obtained from the training process for the purpose of fast training at the next time. Furthermore, the matplot function will plot the graphs of the accuracy rate execution curve and the loss function execution curve in the final. 
Necessary installation of packages and header files include TensorFlow, Keras, os, pandas, NumPy, time, Scikit-learn, matplotlib, OpenCV, etc.
